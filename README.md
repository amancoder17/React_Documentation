# What is React ?

React is a framework that employs Webpack to automatically compile React, JSX, and ES6 code while handling CSS file prefixes. React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.

React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI.

# Why React ?
React’s popularity today has eclipsed that of all other front-end development frameworks. Here is why:

- Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where coding often gets complex very quickly.
- Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web applications do.
- Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and controls, and they can be reused throughout the application, which in turn dramatically reduces the application’s development time.
- Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when designing a React app, developers often nest child components within parent components. Since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where a problem occurs in an application at the moment in question.
- Small learning curve: React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and JavaScript concepts with some beneficial additions. Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks, you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of React’s library.
- It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps: We already know that React is used for the development of web applications, but that’s not all it can do. There is a framework called React Native, derived from React itself, that is hugely popular and is used for creating beautiful mobile applications. So, in reality, React can be used for making both web and mobile applications.
- Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug React applications. This makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and easier.

- React.js builds a customized virtual DOM. Because the JavaScript virtual DOM is quicker than the conventional DOM, this will enhance the performance of apps. 
- ReactJS makes an amazing UI possible. 
- Search - engine friendly ReactJS. 
- Modules and valid data make larger apps easier to manage by increasing readability. 
- React integrates various architectures. 
- React makes the entire scripting environment process simpler. 
- It makes advanced maintenance easier and boosts output. 
- Guarantees quicker rendering 
- The availability of a script for developing mobile apps is the best feature of React.
- ReactJS is supported by a large community.

# Virtual Document Object Model (DOM)

The Virtual DOM is React's lightweight version of the Real DOM. Real DOM manipulation is substantially slower than virtual DOM manipulation. When an object's state changes, Virtual DOM updates only that object in the real DOM rather than all of them.
- What is the Document Object Model (DOM) ?

DOM (Document Object Model) treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure in which each node is an object representing a part of the document.
